# üèÖ Pentathlon: Next Product to Buy (NPTB) Modeling  

This project applies **predictive modeling and personalization analytics** to the **Pentathlon retail case study**. The challenge: determine which promotional email message (or no message at all) maximizes **customer purchases and profitability**, and use machine learning to deliver **personalized campaign recommendations**.

## üìå Project Overview  
Retailers often send promotional emails without knowing which type of message resonates best with each customer. Over-targeting leads to unsubscribes, while under-targeting wastes growth opportunities.  

The **Next Product to Buy (NPTB) framework** allows retailers to:  
- Predict which product or message a customer is most likely to respond to.  
- Optimize campaign allocation across multiple departments.  
- Balance **short-term sales** with **long-term customer retention**.  

**Objectives:**  
1. Predict customer response (purchase probability) after receiving different promotional messages.  
2. Estimate **expected profit per customer** considering both conversion likelihood and order size.  
3. Compare strategies: uniform messaging vs random assignment vs personalized recommendations.  
4. Propose a **new policy for promotional email allocation** based on machine learning insights.

## üîç Methodology  

### 1. Data Preparation  
- **Data Structure:** 600,000 observations of customer‚Äìemail pairs.  
- **Features:**  
  - Demographics: age, gender, income, education, children.  
  - Purchase history: frequency of purchases across 6 product departments.  
  - Experiment design: random assignment to one of six department emails or control (no email).  
- **Outcome Variables:**  
  - **Buyer:** Whether the customer made a purchase (yes/no).  
  - **Total Order Size (OS):** Value of purchase (conditional on buying).

### 2. Modeling Approach  
- **Algorithms Used:**  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forests  
  - Neural Networks  
  - XGBoost  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** AUC, RMSE, R-squared, Gains Curves, Profit Analysis.  
- **Steps Followed:**  
  1. Predict purchase probability for each message per customer.  
  2. Predict expected profit (probability √ó order size √ó margin).  
  3. Identify the **optimal message** (or no message) for each customer.  
  4. Compare profit outcomes across different allocation strategies.

### 3. Business Policy Simulation  
- **Uniform Messaging:** Same email sent to all customers.  
- **Random Assignment:** Current approach (status quo).  
- **Personalized Allocation:** Tailored message per customer, including ‚Äúno message‚Äù option.  
- **Results:**  
  - Personalized targeting **significantly outperforms** both uniform and random approaches.  
  - Estimated lift in profitability for a campaign of **5M customers** when using personalization.
